# AgentUpdate Message

The `AgentUpdate.msg` message is designed to provide real-time updates on the state of an agent within a mission. This message includes critical information such as the agent's pose, velocity, acceleration, yaw rate, and safety radius. It is primarily used in real-time mission planning and collision avoidance systems to monitor and track the state of agents, ensuring that planners or monitoring systems have the most up-to-date information.

This message is essential for applications that require precise and timely updates on agent states, such as autonomous navigation, multi-agent coordination, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

## Message Definition

## Field Descriptions

- **`header`** (`std_msgs/Header`): Standard ROS message header containing a timestamp and frame information.
- **`mission_tag`** (`string`): Unique identifier for the mission associated with this agent update.
- **`agent_tag`** (`string`): Unique identifier for the agent.
- **`pose`** (`geometry_msgs/Pose`): The agent's current position and orientation in the world frame.
- **`velocity`** (`float64`): The agent's current linear velocity (m/s).
- **`acceleration`** (`float64`): The agent's current linear acceleration (m/sÂ²).
- **`yaw_rate`** (`float64`): The agent's angular velocity around the yaw axis (rad/s).
